# Arena Live Chat

![Cypress Tests](https://github.com/benjaminpinto/arena-live-chat/actions/workflows/cypress-tests.yml/badge.svg)

This project is the result of a code challenge that demands the use of Cypress to automate tests upon [Arena Live Chat](https://go.arena.im/chat/cesar/Xed5mok).

To write these tests, I've used a few plugins to extend Cypress capabilities:

- [cypress-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro/);
- [faker-js](https://fakerjs.dev/);
- [cypress-iframe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-iframe)

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I've used versions `v16.15.0` and `8.5.5` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I recommend you to use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

> **Note:** This project uses fake data to perform tests, so the file `cypress.env.json` is being versioned. With sensible data, this doesn't should happen.

> **Important:** This project uses Github actions to implement a simple CI workflow. The [script](./.github/workflows/cypress-tests.yml) is ready with a matrix to make it possible run tests in parallel, if a Cypress Dashboard is available. The plugin [Sorry-Cypress](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress) is also an alternative.

## About the project structure

- Spec files are localized at [`cypress/tests`](/cypress/tests/), separated into e2e and api folders;
- Custom commands are organized at [`support`](cypress/support) folder;
- Test scenarios TC06 and TC07 demands the live chat being published in a different webpage, through an iframe. Attending this requirement, the embed code was generated and it's available at this [Netlify page](https://62c7ceb65521e247db8bf23d--lambent-caramel-a02409.netlify.app/).
