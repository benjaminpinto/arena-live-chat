# XYZ Bank Code Challenge

![Cypress Tests](https://github.com/benjaminpinto/BankingProject/actions/workflows/cypressAction.yml/badge.svg) ![Security OWASP](https://github.com/benjaminpinto/BankingProject/actions/workflows/owaspAction.yml/badge.svg)

This project is a result of a code challenge that demands the use of Cypress to automate tests upon [XYZ Bank application](https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject).

To write these tests, I've used a few plugins to extend Cypress capabilities:

- [cypress-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro/);
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) and [eslint-plugin-cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-cypress);
- [faker-js](https://fakerjs.dev/);
- [cypress-localstorage-commands](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-localstorage-commands)

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I've used versions `v16.15.0` and `8.5.5` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I recommend you to use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

> **Note:** This project doesn't handle sensible data to perform tests (tokens/passwords/etc), so I didn't used a `cypress.env.json` file.

> **Important:** This project uses Github actions to implement CI. If you want to clone it and run at your own repository, remember to update project's ID at [`cypress.config.js`](./cypress.config.js) file, and set your CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY at Github secrets.

## Security Tests

In this project, I'm using OWASP ZAP to perform security verifications. a [Github Action](/.github/workflows/owaspAction.yml) was created to trigger it and, like it happens with Cypress Tests, Security tests are called at every commit on master branch.

The results of the last security test run is available [here](https://benjaminpinto.github.io/BankingProject/).

## About the project structure

- Spec files are localized at [`cypress/e2e`](/cypress/e2e/) folder;
- Custom commands are organized at [`support/pages`](cypress/support/pages) folder;
- Valid customers data is stored at [fixtures/validCustomers.json](/cypress/fixtures/validCustomers.json) and it's used in some tests;
- Github Actions is properly configured and the project tests results are connected with Cypress Dashboard. I've configured parallelization with 4 threads at Github Actions, but considering that I've reached my monthly free tier limit, just one thread is in fact executing all spec files.

## Relevant notes about this project

We have to keep in mind that the application doesn't have a real backend and/or a database connected. At every browser's new session, all data is loaded to local storage at client side.

Considering this, some test scenarios, mainly those that involves data insertion and deletion, was constructed performing assertions referencing the local storage.

When Cypress moves from one `it` block to another, all data from local storage is restored to its default values. In a real scenario, we could navigate to customer's insert page, include a fake customer, then navigate to customer's list page to check if it was properly stored. Due to this specific project's limitation, I am checking all data insertion/deletion by looking to browser's local storage.
